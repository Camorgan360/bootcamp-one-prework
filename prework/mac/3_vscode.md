### Install Visual Studio Code

Now it's time to install Visual Studio Code, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). This will download a `.zip` file, open this file which should extract the `Visual Studio Code.app` file. Drag this app file into your `/Applications` folder.

**TIP:** You can delete the `zip` file.

Once installed, launch using Spotlight Search (`CMD + SpaceBar`).

#### `code` (shell command)

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into VS Code from the Terminal.

Run VS Code, the type `CMD + SHIFT + P` and start typing `Shell Command` and choose `Shell Command: Install code Command in Path`.

To verify VS Code is wired up correctly, run the `code` command from your terminal.

If VS Code does not open, please notify an instructor or TA in your class Ryver forum.
