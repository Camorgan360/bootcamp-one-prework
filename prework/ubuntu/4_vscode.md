### Install Visual Studio Code

Now it's time to install Visual Studio Code, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and run the installer.


Once installed, launch using Spotlight Search.

### `code` (shell command)

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into VS Code from the Terminal.

To verify VS Code is wired up correctly, run the `code` command from your terminal.

If VS Code opens, you're good to go.

If VS Code does not open, please notify an instructor or TA in your class Ryver forum.
