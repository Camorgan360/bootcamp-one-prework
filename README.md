Code 201: Foundations of Software Development
-----------------------

## Pre-work

There is mandatory pre-work for Bootcamp Part One that counts as 5% of your total course grade. You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments in our Learning Management System shortly after you've completed the enrollment process. 

Start as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Expect to spend, **at a minimum**, several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

## Install programs and set up your computer

## Online Tutorials

### ☐ Practice the Terminal *(1-2 hours)*

One significant aspect of creating software is interacting directly with text files. One of the most efficient ways to do this is through the Terminal, or Command Line. Using the terminal may feel a little scary at first, but stick with it and give it some practice. If you aren't already, this is a great time to get used to the command line.

## Purchase textbooks and read preliminary readings

### ☐ Purchase the required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:

  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">Web Design with HTML &amp; CSS; JavaScript &amp; jQuery book set</a> by Jon Duckett

### ☐ Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class *(2-3 hours)*

We get started right away on Day 1, so be sure to read the following chapters from the textbooks AND complete the associated discussion assignments in our Learning Management System (which you will have access to once your enrollment process is complete):

- From the **HTML & CSS** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "Structure"
  - Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
  - Chapter 17: "HTML5 Layout"
  - Chapter 18: "Process & Design"
- From the **JavaScript** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming"

Plan to spend about 20-30 minutes with each chapter. Do not strive to methodically read and retain every single word, because we cover hundreds of pages of text in the first two weeks of the course. Instead, aim for an understanding of the big topics and orientation to where the details are so that you can find them when you need them. And be sure to read closely enough to come up with questions and observations based on your reading!
