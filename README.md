Code 201: Foundations of Software Development
-----------------------

## Pre-work

There is mandatory pre-work for Code 201 that counts as 5% of your total course grade. You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments in our Learning Management System shortly after you've completed the enrollment process. In the meantime, please keep notes on your progress through these pre-work assignments, including the time you have invested in them and also details on any questions or problems you encounter.

Start as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Expect to spend, **at a minimum**, several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

## Overview of Pre-work Steps *(time to complete per item)*

1. Laptop readiness *(time for this can vary widely depending upon the age and condition of your laptop)*
1. Setup guide for Your OS *(multiple downloads are involved; 1-3 hours depending on your network speed)*
1. Download and install Ryver *(15-30 minutes)*
1. Purchase required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*
1. Brush up on algebra *(1-2 hours)*
1. Practice the terminal *(2-3 hours)*
1. Read through a Git tutorial on Udemy *(1-2 hours)*
1. Khan Academy Intro to JavaScript tutorial *(15-40 hours)*
1. Khan Academy HTML+CSS tutorial *(15-25 hours)*
1. Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class *(2-3 hours)*

**Total estimated time for pre-work Steps 3-11: 23.5 to 43 hours of working time (not counting breaks)**

### 1. Ensure your laptop is up to the task of coding *(time for this can vary widely depending upon the age and condition of your laptop)*

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

### 2. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system *(multiple downloads are involved; 1-3 hours depending on your network speed)*

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these installations, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Type `git --version` in your terminal and not receive an error
 - Be able to open VSCode from the Terminal or Git Bash by typing `code .`

### 3. Download and Install Ryver (do this step after your enrollment is completed) *(15-30 minutes)*

We use an app called Ryver to share resources, chat, make announcements, and collaborate. 

You can either use the Ryver web app (codefellowspdx.ryver.com) or use the following link to download the desktop app:

[Ryver Downloads](ryver.com/downloads/).

Once you have joined, add a nice profile picture of your lovely face. Then say hello in your class team, and introduce yourself.

### 4. Purchase the required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:

  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">Web Design with HTML &amp; CSS; JavaScript &amp; jQuery book set</a> by Jon Duckett

### 5. Brush up on Algebra *(1-2 hours)*

Take some time to review essential algebra. These kinds of logical and mathematical concepts will be very useful to you as you dig into writing code.

Here's a list of algebra topics for your review:

You don't need to read through each topic, but you should have familiarity with most of them, especially the basics. Read whatever sections sound interesting to you, plus the section on Functions.

### 6. Practice the Terminal *(1-2 hours)*

One significant aspect of creating software is interacting directly with text files. One of the most efficient ways to do this is through the Terminal, or Command Line. Using the terminal may feel a little scary at first, but stick with it and give it some practice. 

If you aren't already, this is a great time to get used to the command line. Here are a few tutorials that can assist you:

1. **Treehouse** - This is a great set of online video tutorials with practice problems/quizzes.  It is free to try (1 week trial).  

	Do the first part of [Console Foundations](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations) course (just the "Getting Started With the Console" section, which takes about an hour). Feel free to explore the more advanced topics if you wish (Users and Permissions, Environment and Redirection, etc.) but those topics are beyond the scope of our course!

2. **Linux Tutorial** (Mac and Linux are pretty similar): [http://linuxtutorial.todolistme.net](http://linuxtutorial.todolistme.net)

	Please work through sections 1 through 5 of the linux tutorial. Also recommended: 7 and 8.


### 7. Read through this Git tutorial on Udemy *(1-2 hours)*

There is a lot of useful information in this tutorial, but it is a lot to digest for beginners. Read through the Remote Repositories section, then read the Distributed Workflows section through the end.

### 8. JavaScript Tutorials *(15-40 hours)*
Complete these tutorials prior to the first day of class.

   Khan Academy: [Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming)

### 9. HTML and CSS Tutorial *(15-25 hours)*
Complete these tutorials prior to the first day of class.

   Khan Academy (up through and including the **Web development tools** section): [Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)

### 10. Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class *(2-3 hours)*

We get started right away on Day 1, so be sure to read the following chapters from the textbooks AND complete the associated discussion assignments in our Learning Management System (which you will have access to once your enrollment process is complete):

- From the **HTML & CSS** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "Structure"
  - Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
  - Chapter 17: "HTML5 Layout"
  - Chapter 18: "Process & Design"
- From the **JavaScript** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming"

Plan to spend about 20-30 minutes with each chapter. Do not strive to methodically read and retain every single word, because we cover hundreds of pages of text in the first two weeks of the course. Instead, aim for an understanding of the big topics and orientation to where the details are so that you can find them when you need them. And be sure to read closely enough to come up with questions and observations based on your reading!
