Preparing For Success: Prework for Bootcamp
===

## Bootcamp Part One: Foundations of Software Development


### Success Indicators and Outcomes

One of the biggest indicators of we see in graduates of our program getting good paying jobs quickly is how well students keep up on lab work and apply themselves to stretch goals. Starting an intensive bootcamp program can be overwhelming, much like travelling to a foreign country where you don’t know the language or the culture.

While most students adjust to the pace and intensity over the first week or so, for some the adjustment period can create a habit of incomplete work, struggle and demoralizing outcomes that takes much longer to break.

This is why _we ask all students to take preparation seriously!_ We are asking you to go through material on your own to develop familiarity and practice using your laptop as a development tool. Focus on putting in the hours and dedication, but don’t worry about comprehension! This may seem counterintuitive, but our instructors will cover the material again, in different ways and adding more practical application. And once you start focusing on delivering labs and projects, you won’t be able to escape the things you need to know!

### Pre-work

The pre-work for Bootcamp Part One is mandatory and counts as 5% of your total course grade. You'll have the opportunity to report your progress on these assignments in our Learning Management System shortly after you've completed the enrollment process. 

Start as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Expect to spend, **at a minimum**, several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

### Bootcamp Prep

All students are encourage to attend our Bootcamp Prep course, though it is not strictly required. Bootcamp Prep requires the same prework listed here, but offers students a week of evenings with an instructor to review high-level concepts and answer questions - as well as tips and tricks for getting the most out of your computer and the covered material. Contact admissions@alchemycodelab.com for more information.

### Online Tutorials

#### ☐ Practice the Terminal *(1-2 hours)*

One significant aspect of creating software is interacting directly with text files. One of the most efficient ways to do this is through the Terminal, or Command Line. Using the terminal may feel a little scary at first, but stick with it and give it some practice. If you aren't already, this is a great time to get used to the command line.

### Purchase textbooks and read preliminary readings

#### ☐ Purchase the required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:

  - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1119038634/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=">Web Design with HTML &amp; CSS; JavaScript &amp; jQuery book set</a> by Jon Duckett

#### ☐ Complete the textbook readings for Day 1 of class *(2-3 hours)*

We get started right away on Day 1, so be sure to read the following chapters from the textbooks AND complete the associated discussion assignments in our Learning Management System (which you will have access to once your enrollment process is complete):

- From the **HTML & CSS** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "Structure"
  - Chapter 8: "Extra Markup"
  - Chapter 17: "HTML5 Layout"
  - Chapter 18: "Process & Design"
- From the **JavaScript** textbook:
  - Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming"

Plan to spend about 20-30 minutes with each chapter. Do not strive to methodically read and retain every single word, because we cover hundreds of pages of text in the first two weeks of the course. Instead, aim for an understanding of the big topics and orientation to where the details are so that you can find them when you need them. And be sure to read closely enough to come up with questions and observations based on your reading!
